# NYC-taxi-and-Limousine-trips-Data-Analyst-Project-pyspark
In this project, we use data from New York City Taxi and Limousine commission about Green Taxis. We use the data from September 2015. Here is the source page:

We use pyspark to do some tasks and add creative ideas to manage to dig out the dataset, including data cleaning, data transformation, data visualization and also apply some machine learning methods like Kmeans to cluster the locations. 
Finally some suggestions are proposed based on the detailed analysis.
